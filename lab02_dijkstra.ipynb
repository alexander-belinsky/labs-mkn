    "In this lab, we will consider the problem of finding the shortest path on a graph with a special structure, widely used in robotics and computer games — a grid. The grid consists of both free and blocked cells, and an agent can move from one free cell to another. The connectivity of the grid may vary; for example, a grid might be 4-connected when only cardinal moves (N, E, W, S) are allowed, or 8-connected when diagonal moves are allowed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lab, we assume that the grid is 4-connected**, meaning that only moves into the cardinal directions (N, E, W, S) are allowed. The cost of each move between two neighboring cells, represented as $v$ and $v'$, is uniform, with $cost(v, v') = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the seminal `Dijkstra` algorithm for finding the shortest path on a grid. However, our focus is on implementing this algorithm as a \"heuristic search without heuristic,\" utilizing the distinct `SearchNode` structure, along with concepts like `Open` and `Closed`.\n",
